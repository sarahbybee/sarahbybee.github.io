#Using Reticulate

Do you ever hit a snag when coding and think, "Dang! I know how to do this in Python, but I've already started my project in R!" Never fear, there is a quick and easy way to switch between coding languages.

Reticulate lets R and Python talk to each other, so you can convert R objects to Python objects and Python objects back into R objects. It offers the perfect solution for when you want to use a different coding language.

As a quick example, let's look at the USArrests dataset built into R.

```{R}
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)
```

USArrests has statistics in arrests per 100,000 residents for violent crimes in each US state in 1973. The dataset also contains the percent of the population in urban areas.

```{R}
glimpse(USArrests)
usarrests <- USArrests
```

We can save this data in R and then look at some summary statistics using Python.

```{python}
r.usarrests.describe()
```

Not exactly the most uplifting results... but it does show that you can switch between R and Python whenever you want by using reticulate.
